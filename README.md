MERN Application - Student Management System
Overview
This project is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application that serves as a Student Management System. It allows users to manage students, tutors, and tutorials through a user-friendly web interface. The backend of the application acts as an API, and users can interact with it using tokens for authentication.

Features
Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for students, tutors, and tutorials.
Secure authentication using tokens.
Easy-to-use forms for adding new students, tutors, and tutorials.
Visual representation of student, tutor, and tutorial details.

Authentication
The app uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. When a user signs up or logs in, a token is generated and stored in local storage. The token is used for API requests that require authentication.
